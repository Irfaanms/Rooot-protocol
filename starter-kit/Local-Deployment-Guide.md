# ROOOt Starter Kit — Local Deployment

This document provides practical guidance for deploying ROOOt at local, human scale.

This includes:
- community setup
- stewardship verification
- exchange practices
- conflict handling
- exit and fork procedures

ROOOt is designed to work without central authority.
Local implementations may differ, but must respect protocol invariants.
