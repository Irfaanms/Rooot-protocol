# ROOOt Protocol & Whitepaper (Draft v1)

> **Status:** Draft (canonical direction, still evolving)  
> **Purpose:** Define what ROOOt is, why it exists, how it works, and what must never change.  
> **Warning:** ROOOt is not an investment asset, not a token sale, and not governed by wealth.

## 0. Executive Summary

ROOOt is a commons protocol for contribution, access, and stewardship.  
It is designed to prevent capture, domination, and ecological harm while remaining usable at local, human scale.

ROOOt creates a unit of exchange that rewards:
- real contribution
- honest verification
- long-term stewardship of life systems (soil, water, forests, habitat)

ROOOt blocks:
- rent extraction
- accumulation-based power
- privilege tiers
- capture via governance or wealth

---

## 1. The Problem ROOOt Solves

Modern money systems reward extraction:
- taking more than needed
- converting nature into profit
- turning survival into leverage

As automation and AI increase, labor-based access to survival becomes unstable:
- jobs disappear
- inequality grows
- fragile states suffer first
- nature is depleted faster

ROOOt is designed to keep survival and dignity functional even when traditional labor markets fail.

---

## 2. What ROOOt Is

ROOOt is:
- a commons accounting unit
- a coordination protocol for contribution and access
- a system that ties value to life needs and stewardship
- a forkable public good

ROOOt is not:
- a security or investment product
- a centrally issued currency
- a company-owned platform
- a system controlled by tokens, capital, or identity gatekeeping

---

## 3. Core Mechanisms (Plain Language)

### 3.1 Contribution → Access
People earn ROOOt by doing work recognized as useful by the community.

### 3.2 Verification → Fraud Friction
Work is validated by those close to the outcome, so lying becomes expensive.

### 3.3 Caps → Anti-Domination
No one can accumulate enough ROOOt to dominate others.

### 3.4 Stewardship → Rewarding the Living World
Nature-supporting actions earn ROOOt using staged verification over time.

## 4. Non-Negotiable Invariants (Constitution)

These are outside governance forever:

1. **Fixed total supply:** 10,000,000,000,000 ROOOt  
2. **Per-human usable cap:** 5,000,000 ROOOt  
3. **No minting after genesis**  
4. **No accumulation-based power**  
5. **No rent extraction**  
6. **Exit is always allowed**

Any system that violates these is **not ROOOt**.

---

## 5. Commons Peg (Anchoring to Life Needs)

ROOOt must remain meaningful without speculation.

Communities use a **Commons Peg** anchored to life needs such as:
- a meal unit
- a transport segment
- 10 minutes average labor
- a basic water+energy day

This peg is local-first, practical, and adjustable by local commons governance.

---

## 6. Identity, Access, and Inclusion

ROOOt must function in:
- high-tech cities
- low-connectivity regions
- places with low literacy
- communities without smartphones

ROOOt uses **trust tiers** so survival is never blocked by KYC:
- Tier 0: local anonymous use with small limits
- Tier 1: community verified use with higher limits
- Tier 2: strong proof-of-personhood for maximum portability and cap-level use

---

## 7. Safety & Anti-Coercion

ROOOt is designed for the real world:
- theft exists
- coercion exists
- state pressure exists

ROOOt uses:
- pocket vs vault wallets
- duress/decoy modes
- spend limits and delays
- social recovery without central control

(See: `/security/`)

---

## 8. Governance (No Global Rulers)

No one governs ROOOt globally.

People govern their own commons:
- locally
- temporarily
- only where coordination is unavoidable

Bad governance is corrected by **exit and forks — not force**.

(See: `/governance/`)

---

## 9. Adoption Path

ROOOt spreads by replication, not marketing:
- mutual aid circles
- transport co-ops
- community kitchens
- local repair networks
- diaspora support networks

ROOOt must be useful without platforms, without hype, and without permission.

---

## 10. Closing Statement

ROOOt protects people, not assets.

If ROOOt survives, it will be because it is:
- practical
- forkable
- resistant to capture
- anchored to life and stewardship
