# ROOOt Protocol

ROOOt is a commons protocol for contribution, access, and stewardship.
It is designed to prevent capture, domination, and ecological harm
while remaining usable at local, human scale.

This repository is the canonical public home of the ROOOt protocol.

## What This Repository Is

- A **protocol specification**, not a product
- A **commons reference**, not a company
- A **forkable public good**, not an investment
- A place to **study, audit, replicate, and build**

---

## What This Repository Is Not

- Not a startup
- Not a token sale
- Not a platform that owns users
- Not governed by wealth, tokens, or corporations

---

## Canonical Documents

The following documents define ROOOt.  
If something is not listed here, it is not canonical.

### Core
- Protocol & Whitepaper
- Starter Kit (Local Deployment)

### Safety & Integrity
- Security, Authentication & Trust Specification
- User Safety (1-Page Guide)

### Governance
- Governance & Commons Specification

---

## Non-Negotiable Invariants

These are outside governance forever:

- Fixed total supply
- Per-human usable cap
- No accumulation-based power
- No rent extraction
- Exit is always allowed

Any system that violates these is **not ROOOt**.

---

## Governance Philosophy

No one governs ROOOt globally.

People govern **their own commons**, locally, temporarily,
and only where coordination is unavoidable.

Bad governance is corrected by exit and forks — not force.

---

## Status

This is a living protocol.
Forks are expected.
Capture attempts will fail by design.

If ROOOt survives, it will be because it is useful without permission.
