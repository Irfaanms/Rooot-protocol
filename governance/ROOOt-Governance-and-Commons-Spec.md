# ROOOt Governance & Commons Specification (Draft v1)

> **Principle:** No one governs ROOOt globally.
>  
> Governance exists only where coordination is unavoidable.

---

## 1. What Governance Is (and Is Not)

Governance in ROOOt is:
- local
- temporary
- scoped
- revocable by exit

Governance in ROOOt is **not**:
- permanent
- global
- token-weighted
- wealth-weighted
- coercive

If governance becomes extractive, it has already failed.

---

## 2. Commons-First Design

ROOOt is a **commons protocol**, not a platform.

- No central treasury
- No protocol-owned profit
- No rent extraction
- No privileged operators

Value flows through contribution and stewardship, not control.

---

## 3. Non-Negotiable Invariants (Ungovernable)

The following are **outside governance forever**:

- Fixed total supply
- Per-human usable cap
- No accumulation-based power
- No rent extraction
- Exit is always allowed
- Forking is always allowed

Any system that violates these is **not ROOOt**.

---

## 4. Local Governance Units (Commons Cells)

Governance only occurs in **Commons Cells**:
- neighborhoods
- bioregions
- cooperatives
- projects
- stewardship groups

Each cell may define:
- coordination rules
- contribution recognition
- dispute resolution methods

Cells **cannot**:
- change protocol invariants
- block exit
- impose global rules

---

## 5. Decision Scope & Sunset

All governance decisions must specify:
- scope
- duration
- exit path

Default rule:
> **All authority expires unless renewed.**

No permanent councils.

---

## 6. Forking as the Ultimate Check

If governance fails:
- participants exit
- implementations fork
- legitimacy drains automatically

ROOOt does not suppress forks.
ROOOt **expects** them.

---

## 7. No Voting by Wealth or Tokens

- Tokens do not grant authority
- Wealth does not amplify voice
- Influence comes from:
  - contribution
  - trust
  - continued participation

Anyone can leave at any time.

---

## 8. Resistance to Capture

ROOOt resists capture by:
- limiting accumulation
- eliminating rents
- removing global choke points
- making compliance optional
- making exit easy

Capture attempts fragment power instead of concentrating it.

---

## 9. Relationship to States and Institutions

ROOOt does not seek permission.

- States may interact locally
- Institutions may adopt voluntarily
- No entity can mandate compliance at protocol level

ROOOt survives partial adoption and partial resistance.

---

## 10. Governance Invariant

> **Power that cannot be exited is illegitimate.**

ROOOt treats exit as a feature, not a failure.

---

## Status

This is a living specification.
Governance evolves by practice, not decree.

If ROOOt survives, it will be because people choose it freely.
